why js is called objects oriented programming languages?
  JavaScript is called an object-oriented programming (OOP) language because it uses 
objects and classes to create code .

Iterators and generators
 iterators and Generators bring the concept of iteration directly into the core language

 EXAMPLE OF ITERATORES
 const myArray = [1, 2, 3];
  An iterator is an object that provides a way to access the elements of a collection 
(like arrays or custom objects) 

const iterator = myArray[Symbol.iterator]();

console.log(iterator.next()); // { value: 1, done: false }
console.log(iterator.next()); // { value: 2, done: false }
console.log(iterator.next()); // { value: 3, done: false }
console.log(iterator.next()); // { value: undefined, done: true }
  
A generator is a special type of function that can pause its execution and resume later

function* myGenerator() {
  yield 1;
  yield 2;
  yield 3;
}

const gen = myGenerator();

console.log(gen.next()); // { value: 1, done: false }
console.log(gen.next()); // { value: 2, done: false }
console.log(gen.next()); // { value: 3, done: false }
console.log(gen.next()); // { value: undefined, done: true }

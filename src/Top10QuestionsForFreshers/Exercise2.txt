What is the difference between 
useEffect and useLayoutEffect? 

Answer:
---------------useEffect will run after the component is mounted on the dom 
A useEffect runs asynchronously 
after the paint has been committed to
 the screen, 
///// "paint" refers to the process where the browser renders the visual representation of your components to the screen
while useLayoutEffect runs synchronously
before the paint. This means 

useLayoutEffect 
---------------useLayoutEffect will run before the component is mounted on the dom 

can block the visual update, 
which is useful for measuring 
layout or updating the DOM 
before the browser paints.

examples : when measuring DOM elements, or animating or transitioning elements.

-- Debugger in the js
 The remaining section of the code should stop execution before moving on to the next line while debugging.

-- exec and test 

test () and exec () are RegExp expression methods used in javascript.

 We'll use exec () to search a string for a specific pattern, and if it finds 
 it, it'll return the pattern directly; else, it'll return an 'empty' result.

 We will use a test () to find a string for a specific pattern. It will return 
 the Boolean value 'true' on finding the given text otherwise, it will return 'false'

 --Scope Chain: 
 JavaScript engine also uses Scope to find variables.

 -- object protoypes 
 All javascript objects inherit properties from a prototype

   Math objects inherit properties from the Math prototype 
 Array objects inherit properties from the Array prototype.

 --callback function 
   Functions that are used as an argument to another function are called callback functions

-- constructor
  Constructor functions are used to create objects in javascript. 

--Which method is used to retrieve a character from a certain index?
 charAt() 

-- creating objects method 
Object.
using Class.
using Function.
Object Constructor.

------------meaning of inheritance is---------relation

--Difference between prototypal and classical inheritance

inheritance - parambarai...

prototypal inhertance :
* JavaScript uses prototype inheritance to allow objects to share properties and methods. 
* following languages js

Object.prototype.name = "hari"

syntax : Object.setPrototypeOf(para1,para2) , Object.getPrototypeOf(para1,para2) 
CODE ---------------------------------------------------
let newVal = {
    name : "hari",
    id: 12211
}
let newVal1 = {}
Object.setPrototypeOf(newVal,newVal1)

console.log(newVal) // {}
console.log(newVal1.name) // hari

* we could be able to inherit the objects from the one to another 

classical inhertance :
* following languages java ,c++, c 
* we could not be able to inherit the objects from the one to another 



What do you mean by JavaScript Design Patterns?
That allows the creation of new objects by copying (or "cloning") an existing object

They are divided mainly into 3 categories

1.Creational Design Pattern
2.Structural Design Pattern
3.Behavioral Design Pattern.

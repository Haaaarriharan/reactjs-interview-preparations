// Ques 5 - Best Time to Buy and Sell Stocks
// You are given an array prices where prices[i] is the price of a given stock
// on the ith day.
// You want to maximize your profit by choosing a single day to buy one stock
// and choosing a different day in the future to sell that stock.
// Return the maximum profit, If you cannot achieve any profit, return 0.

// Input: prices = [7, 1, 5, 3, 6, 4];  ----->>>>>  Output: 5;
// Input: prices = [7, 6, 4, 3, 1];     ----->>>>>  Output: 0;

// brute-force Solution approach
function maxProfit1(prices) {
    // first we need to create a brouteforece solutions
  let globalProfit = 0;

  for (let i = 0; i < prices.length - 1; i++) {
    // we are using the this type loop approaches for reducing the time complexity need to check after i...
    for (let j = i + 1; j < prices.length; j++) {
      const currentProfit = prices[j] - prices[i];
      if (currentProfit > globalProfit) globalProfit = currentProfit;
    }
  } 

  return globalProfit;
}
console.log("maxProfit1" , maxProfit1())

BIG O NOTATIONS 
- ITS ABOUT THE NUMBER OF OPERATION TAKE PLACE ...
- AND TIME COMPLEXITY AND THE SPACE COMPLEXITY ...

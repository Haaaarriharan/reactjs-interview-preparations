Serving static files in an Express application is common for several reasons:

* Delivering Assets to Clients: Static files include assets like images, CSS, 
JavaScript files, fonts, and HTML pages. Serving these directly allows clients
 (browsers) to load and render the web page properly.

* Performance: By serving static files directly, you reduce the load on your server
 since these files don't require processing by the backend. They can be served 
 quickly and efficiently.

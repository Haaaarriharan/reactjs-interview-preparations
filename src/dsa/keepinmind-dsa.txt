1. Understand the Problem Statement:
* Read carefully :  Make sure you understand the input, output, and constraints.
* Identify the goal :  What exactly is the problem asking for? This might be finding 
the maximum/minimum, counting occurrences, sorting, or optimizing performance.
* Consider corner cases like empty inputs, negative numbers, large values, etc.

2. Analyze the Input and Output:
* What is the size of the input? (This affects the choice of algorithm.)
* Are there any restrictions (sorted arrays, distinct elements)?
* What is the expected output format?

3.Choose a Suitable Data Structure:
* Arrays
* Hashmaps/Sets
* Stacks/Ques
* Trees/Graphs

4. Identify the Algorithmic Approach:
* Brute force: Try every possible solution (only if the input size is small).
* Greedy algorithm: Make local optimal choices at each step.
* Divide and conquer: Split the problem into smaller subproblems, solve them, and combine results.

5. Plan the Solution:
6. Implement the Solution:
7. Optimize the Solution:
8.  Test the Solution Extensively:

Key Algorithms and Data Structures to Know:

Sorting Algorithms:

Bubble Sort, Selection Sort: Basic sorting algorithms (O(n²))
Merge Sort, Quick Sort: Divide and conquer algorithms (O(n log n)).

Searching Algorithms:
* Linear Search: Simple O(n) search through a collection.
* Binary Search: Efficient O(log n) search in a sorted array.
* Depth-First Search (DFS): Recursive or stack-based search in trees and graphs.
* Breadth-First Search (BFS): Queue-based search for level-order traversal in trees and shortest paths in unweighted graphs.

Dynamic Programming (DP):
* Memoization and Tabulation: Storing subproblem results to avoid recomputation.

Common DP problems:
* Knapsack problem
* Fibonacci numbers
* Longest Increasing Subsequence (LIS)
* Matrix chain multiplication

Greedy Algorithms:
* Make the locally optimal choice at each step.

Common problems:
* Activity Selection
* Huffman Coding
* Kruskal’s and Prim’s algorithms (for Minimum Spanning Tree)

Recursion:
Solving problems by breaking them into smaller instances of the same problem.
* Backtracking: Like in solving puzzles or generating permutations.
* Divide and Conquer: Like merge sort or quicksort.

Graph Algorithms:
* Graph representation: Adjacency matrix/list.
* DFS and BFS: For exploring graphs.
* Dijkstra’s Algorithm: Shortest path in weighted graphs.
* Bellman-Ford, Floyd-Warshall: Handling negative weights or finding all-pairs shortest paths.

Tree Data Structures:
* Binary Trees, Binary Search Trees (BSTs).
* Heaps: For priority queues (e.g., in Dijkstra's algorithm).
* Trie: Efficiently storing strings for prefix searches.

Sliding Window:
* Useful for finding subarrays in an array with specific properties (e.g., max sum subarray).

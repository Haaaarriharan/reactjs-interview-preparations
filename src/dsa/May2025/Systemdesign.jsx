    // In the rest api when we retriving he large amount of data at the time rest api will be not user friendly 

    // GRAPE QL
    // MULTIPLE API CALLS IN A SINGLE API CALL

    // VERTICAL SCALLING 
    // MEANS INCREASING THE RAM , CPU AND STORAGE THIS WILL INCREASE THE EFFICIENCY OF THE SERVER

    // VERRTICAL SCALLING LIMMITATION 
    // WE CANNOT INCREASE THE SERVER EVERY TIME 
    // MORE POWWER FULL SEERVER MORE EXPENSIVE
    
    // HORIZONTAL SCALLING 
    // KIND OF MICRO SERVERS THING 

    // SUPPOSE WE HAVE A THREE SERVER HOW THE FRONT END KNOW WHICH SERVER TO CONNECT IN THIS CASE LOAD BALANCER WILL ARRIVE
    
    // LOAD BLANCER 
      //  load balancer sits between client and server acting as a traffic manager this will distribute the request across a multiple server

      
    // VERTICAL PARTITIONING
    // IS USED WHEN WE CREATE A MORE THAN 1000 COLUMNS WE CAN SEPERATE UPTO 500 SEPERATE DB -500 SEPERATE DB
    
    // DE NORMALIZATION

    // SUPPOSE WE HAVE 2 TABLES USER AND ORDER WE NEED A FETCH USER AND ORDER DATAS THEN INSTEAD OF CREATING 2 TABLES 
    // CAN HANDLE IT IN THE USER_ORDER TABLES

    // IDEMPOTENCY 
    // MEANING IS SUPPOSE DUE TO NETWORK ERROR YOU HAVE A 2 REQUEST AT THE SAME TIME ONE WILL BE REJECTED ONE REQUEST WILL BE USED

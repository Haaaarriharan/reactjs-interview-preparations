Linear Search 
 * the linear search is also called as sequential search
 * using the traditional for loop for finding the values in the array is the linear search

Binary Search
 * binary search is a searching technique which work on the divide and the conquer approach
 * if is used to search any element in the sorted array

Depth first search?
>>>>> pre order traversal
* read the data of the node * visit the left sub tree * visit the right sub tree
>>>>> in order traversal
* visit the left sub tree * read the data of the node * visit the right sub tree
>>>>> post order traversal
* visit the left sub tree * visit the right sub tree * read the data of the node 

need to work practically with some realtime problems

Breadth first search? 

need to read more about the depth first search

why we want to learn data structures?
